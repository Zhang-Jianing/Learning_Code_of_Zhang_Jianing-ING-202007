# Hello!
This GitHub repository records a part of the code I wrote when I was studying OI, including the code of common problems and their divergence, the template of important algorithm or data structure, etc. I hope that through this repository, I can consolidate knowledge, backup code, and I hope to help you as I can for passing by. If you like, welcome to order a star for it, which will be a great encouragement to me.
